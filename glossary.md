## DLSS

**D**eep **L**earning **S**uper **S**ampling (DLSS) is an NVIDIA RTX technology that uses the power of AI to boost your frame rates in games with graphically-intensive workloads. With DLSS, gamers can use higher resolutions and settings while still maintaining solid framerates.

## FFR

**F**ixed **F**oveated **R**endering is a type of Foveated Rendering technique which doesn't utilise eye tracking and assumes a fixed focal point.

## FOV

The **F**ield **O**f **V**iew is the extent of the observable game world that is seen on the display at any given moment. It is typically measured as an angle.

## FSR

AMD **F**idelityFX™ **S**uper **R**esolution (FSR) is AMD's open source, high-quality solution for producing high resolution frames from lower resolution inputs. It uses a collection of cutting-edge algorithms with a particular emphasis on creating high-quality edges, giving large performance improvements compared to rendering at native resolution directly. FSR enables “practical performance” for costly render operations, such as hardware ray tracing.

## NIS

**N**Vidia **I**mage **S**caling (NIS) is an open source, best-in-class, spatial upscaler and sharpening algorithm that works cross-platform on all GPUs. The NVIDIA Image Scaling SDK provides a single spatial scaling and sharpening algorithm for cross-platform support.

## OpenXR

OpenXR is a structured set of instructions and rules for developers to create applications (such as Flight Simulator 2020) that use virtual reality or augmented reality (or XR as the industry calls it) that run on modern devices (such as the HP Reverb or Oculus Quest).

## VRS and VRSS

**V**ariable **R**ate **S**hading (VRS) and **V**ariable **R**ate **S**uper** S**ampling (VRSS) are similar techniques used to allocate GPU rendering resources selectively. VRS allows developers to selectively reduce the shading rate in areas of the frame where it won’t affect visual quality, letting them gain extra performance in their games. VRS also lets developers do the opposite: using an increased shading rate only in areas where it matters most, meaning even better visual quality in games.
