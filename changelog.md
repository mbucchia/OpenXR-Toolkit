- Add CPU-bound indicator and CPU headroom measurements in the overlay.
- Add support for left/right eye biasing with Fixed Foveated Rendering (allow for lower resolution in one eye).
- Properly handle Fixed Foveated Rendering with lower in-game render scale (no lower than 51%).
- Add trigger-on-haptics to the hand tracking support (simulate a button press upon game haptics + programmed gesture).
- Add an option to override the OpenXR target resolution for each application.
- Add an option to enable/disable Motion Reprojection for each application (Windows Mixed Reality only).
