## Requirements

### Supported headsets

OpenXR Toolkit is compatible with any headset with OpenXR capabilities on PC, whether through the headset's specific OpenXR support (sometimes referred to as "native OpenXR runtime") or through SteamVR OpenXR support. Please refer to the table below for possible combinations of headsets and runtimes.

| Headset brand | Supports OpenXR Toolkit? | OpenXR runtimes available |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows Mixed Reality (HP Reverb, Samsung Odyssey...) | Yes | OpenXR for Windows Mixed Reality, SteamVR OpenXR |

#### Eye tracking feature

The eye tracking feature of OpenXR Toolkit is supported on a majority of headsets with eye tracking capabilities. However, not all OpenXR runtimes for the headset may provide eye tracking support. Please see the table below for possible combinations, and whether a separate add-on is needed for eye tracking.

| Headset brand | OpenXR runtime | Supports eye tracking in OpenXR Toolkit? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HP Reverb G2 Omnicept | OpenXR for Windows Mixed Reality | Yes |
| HP Reverb G2 Omnicept | SteamVR OpenXR | Yes [1] |
| Oculus Quest Pro via Oculus Link | Oculus OpenXR | Yes |
| Oculus Quest Pro via Oculus Link | SteamVR OpenXR | No |
| Oculus Quest Pro via Virtual Desktop | VirtualDesktopXR (VDXR) | Yes |
| Oculus Quest Pro via Virtual Desktop | SteamVR OpenXR | Yes [1] |
| Varjo (all models) | Varjo OpenXR | Yes |
| Varjo (all models) | SteamVR OpenXR | Yes [1] |
| Pimax Crystal | PimaxXR | Yes |
| Pimax Crystal | SteamVR OpenXR | Yes [1] |
| Pimax (5K, 8K) with Droolon Pi1 | PimaxXR | Yes |
| Pimax (5K, 8K) with Droolon Pi1 | SteamVR OpenXR | No |
| HTC Vive Pro Eye, Vive Focus 3 | All | Yes [2] |
| Pico Neo 4 Pro | All | No [3] |

[1] Support for eye tracking through SteamVR OpenXR is provided through the [OpenXR-Eye-Trackers](https://github.com/mbucchia/OpenXR-Eye-Trackers/wiki) add-on.

[2] Support for eye tracking on Vive headsets is provided through the [Vive Console for SteamVR](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1635730/VIVE_Console_for_SteamVR/).

[3] **Pico devices do not support eye tracking for PC applications. Pico does not provide the necessary tools to implement it. The marketing of Pico devices is misleading for the consumers**, and hurts the developers community: a) Pico marketing claims support for eye tracking without mentioning that this feature is only supported for standalone mode (Android apps) and not available to developers on PC; b) This practice makes us developers look bad for not supporting eye tracking, in spite of the shortcoming being on Pico's side

### Supported graphics cards

OpenXR Toolkit is compatible with any graphics card supporting DirectX 11, regardless of brand.

Certain features, like Foveated Rendering, have additional requirements, per the table below. OpenXR Toolkit does not support Vulkan applications, regardless of graphics cards.

| Graphics card | Supports Foveated Rendering? | Limitations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Nvidia RTX 4000 series | Yes | Application must use Direct3D 11 or Direct3D 12 |
| Nvidia RTX 3000 series | Yes | Application must use Direct3D 11 or Direct3D 12 |
| Nvidia RTX 2000 series | Yes | Application must use Direct3D 11 or Direct3D 12 |
| Nvidia GTX 1600 series | Yes | Application must use Direct3D 11 or Direct3D 12 |
| Nvidia GTX 1000 series (and below) | No | - |
| AMD RX 7000 series | Yes | Application must use Direct3D 12 [1] |
| AMD RX 6000 series | Yes | Application must use Direct3D 12 [1] |
| AMD RX 5000 series (and below) | No | - |
| Intel Arc | Yes | Application must use Direct3D 12 [1] |
| Intel Gen11 (Ice Lake and above) | Yes (but untested) | Application must use Direct3D 12 [1] |
| Intel (any other model) | No | - |

[1] AMD and Intel do not support foveated rendering with Direct3D applications. This is a limitation of the AMD and Intel drivers and not a limitation of OpenXR Toolkit.

## Installation

### 1. Run the `OpenXR-Toolkit.msi` program.

![Installer file](site/installer-file.png)

> üìù **Note:** You may be warned that Windows protected your PC because this software is not trusted. The application is built on a GitHub server hosted in the Microsoft cloud, which greatly limits the risk of contamination from viruses and malware. Additionally, we have digitally signed the software through a reputable organization (Comodo) which helps with guaranteeing that is has not been altered by any third party.

> üìù **Note:** You do not need to uninstall the previous version of OpenXR Toolkit if you had one installed. The new version will overwrite the previous one.

### 3. Launch the _OpenXR Toolkit Companion app_ to confirm that the software is active.

<details>
  <summary>You can use the shorcut found on the desktop or in the Start menu...</summary>

  <img alt="Companion app shortcut" src="site/companion-start.png">
  
</details>

The _OpenXR Toolkit Companion app_ may be used sporadically to enable or disable advanced features or perform recovery (see further below). The application displays a green or red status indicating whether the software OpenXR component is active.

The _OpenXR Toolkit Companion app_ can also be used to customize the keyboard shortcuts used to invoke and navigate the menu.

![Companion app](site/hotkeys.png)

> üí° **Tip:** You don't need to keep the companion app running in order to use the software: the actual settings for the toolkit are available from within your OpenXR application and display directly in the headset! (see below). 

# Basic usage

Once installed, please run the desired OpenXR application. A welcome message will appear and instruct you to open the menu:

![On-screen menu](site/welcome.png)
