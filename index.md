...or expore [all versions](https://github.com/mbucchia/OpenXR-Toolkit/releases).

## Requirements

This software may be used with any brand of VR headset as long as the target application uses DirectX with any GPU compatible with DirectX 11 and above. The application must use OpenXR.

The following headsets have been confirmed to work: Windows Mixed Reality (eg: HP Reverb), Oculus Quest & Quest 2, Pimax 5K & 8KX, Varjo Aero, Valve Index, HTC Vive, Pico Neo.

The following OpenXR ToolKit features have additional restrictions:

+ Fixed Foveated Rendering and Foveated Rendering are only supported with the following GPUs:

  + Varjo-brand devices.
  + HP G2 Omnicept.
  + Pimax-brand devices with Droolon eye tracking module. 

## Limitations

+ This software may not work with all OpenXR applications. See the [Compatibility](compat) list.
  + It can also be used with certain OpenVR applications through [OpenComposite](opencomposite).
+ If using with an HTC Vive Cosmos, please select SteamVR as your OpenXR runtime.
+ If using with a Pimax headset, consider using [PimaxXR](https://github.com/mbucchia/Pimax-OpenXR/wiki) as your OpenXR runtime.
+ Foveated Rendering in Microsoft Flight Simulator is incorrectly applied in the main menu, resulting in blurry menu windows.
+ The OpenXR Toolkit is incompatible with ReShade.
+ See the [open bugs](https://github.com/mbucchia/OpenXR-Toolkit/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug).

![Installer file](site/installer-file.png)

> üìù **Note:** You may be warned that Windows protected your PC because this software is not trusted. The application is built on a GitHub server hosted in the Microsoft cloud, which greatly limits the risk of contamination from viruses and malware. Additionally, we have digitally signed the software through a reputable organization (Comodo) which helps with guaranteeing that is has not been altered by any third party.

> üí° **Tip:** You don't need to keep the companion app running in order to use the software: the actual settings for the toolkit are available from within your OpenXR application and display directly in the headset! (see below). 

# Basic usage

Once installed, please run the desired OpenXR application and use `CTRL+F2` to open the configuration menu:
